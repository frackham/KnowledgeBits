Could insert a background sheet for TFS to work with?

These are then executable!! ‚Äúselecting File, Save Query As‚Äù (Assume same for Azure devops?).

git log ae7a0e86..feature/69575_69585_69587_AdminUI ‚Äìoneline
specific commit of a different branch
feature branch
Tried and works in VS code terminal ‚Äì shows summary of commit messages between the 2.
git diff ae7a0e86..feature/69575_69585_69587_AdminUI --compact-summary
git diff ae7a0e86..feature/69575_69585_69587_AdminUI --compact-summary
specific commit of a different branch
feature branch
For files:
--compact-summary
remove cached git folder so gitignore picks it up
git rm -r --cached myFolder
git  avoid assume unchanged for (e.g.) gitignore
You want skip-worktree.    [   git update-index --skip-worktree <file_name>   ]
assume-unchanged is designed for cases where it is expensive to check whether a group of files have been modified; when you set the bit, git (of course) assumes the files corresponding to that portion of the index have not been modified in the working copy. So it avoids a mess of stat calls. This bit is lost whenever the file's entry in the index changes (so, when the file is changed upstream).
skip-worktree is more than that: even where git knows that the file has been modified (or needs to be modified by a reset --hard or the like), it will pretend it has not been, using the version from the index instead. This persists until the index is discarded.
There is a good summary of the ramifications of this difference and the typical use cases here: http://fallengamer.livejournal.com/93321.html .
From that article:
‚Ä¢           --assume-unchanged assumes that a developer shouldn‚Äôt change a file. This flag is meant for improving performance for not-changing folders like SDKs.
‚Ä¢           --skip-worktree is useful when you instruct git not to touch a specific file ever because developers should change it. For example, if the main repository upstream hosts some production-ready configuration files and you don‚Äôt want to accidentally commit changes to those files, --skip-worktree is exactly what you want.
